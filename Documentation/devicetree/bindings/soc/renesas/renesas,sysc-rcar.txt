DT bindings for the Renesas R-Car System Controller/Power Domains Driver

== System Controller Node ==

The R-Car System Controller provides the following functions:
  - Control power-shutoff and resume sequence of power domains.
  - Call to clock driver to turn on/off module stop clock for
	on-chip drivers (via pm_runtime apis.)

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "renesas,rcar-gen3-sysc"
		or "renesas,rcar-gen2-sysc" as fallback.

- reg: Compose start address and address range blocks for the device.

Optional nodes:
- pm-domains: This node contains a hierarchy of PM domain nodes, which should
  match the Power Area Hierarchy in the Power Domain Specifications section of
  the device's datasheet.

== PM Domain Nodes ==

Each of the PM domain nodes represents a PM domain, as documented by the
generic PM domain bindings in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt.

The nodes should be named by the real power area names, and thus their names
should be unique.

Required properties:
  - #power-domain-cells: Must be 0.

Optional properties:
- reg: If the PM domain is not always-on, this property must contain the
	the off-set of power domain's base address from sysc's base address.
	Its parent node must contain the following two properties:
	 - #address-cells: Must be 1,
	 - #size-cells: Must be 0.
       If the PM domain is always-on, this property must be omitted.

Example:

This shows a subset of the r8a7795 PM domain hierarchy, containing the
"always-on" domain, 4 its power subdomains (a3sg, a3ir, a3vp, a3vc);
and the a2vc0, a2vc1 domains; which are subdomains of a3vc.

		sysc: system-controller@e6180000 {
			compatible = "renesas,rcar-gen3-sysc";
			reg = <0 0xe6180000 0 0x0400>;

			pm-domains {
				pd_always_on: always_on {
					#address-cells = <1>;
					#size-cells = <0>;
					#power-domain-cells = <0>;

					pd_a3sg: a3sg {
						reg = <0x0100>;
						#power-domain-cells = <0>;
					};

					pd_a3ir: a3ir {
						reg = <0x0180>;
						#power-domain-cells = <0>;
					};

					pd_a3vp: a3vp {
						reg = <0x0340>;
						#power-domain-cells = <0>;
					};

					pd_a3vc: a3vc {
						reg = <0x0380>;
						#address-cells = <1>;
						#size-cells = <0>;
						#power-domain-cells = <0>;

						pd_a2vc0: a2vc0 {
							reg = <0x03C0>;
							#power-domain-cells = <0>;
						};

						pd_a2vc1: a2vc1 {
							reg = <0x03C0>;
							#power-domain-cells = <0>;
						};
					};
				};
			};
		};

== PM Domain Consumers ==
Hardware blocks belonging to a PM domain should contain a "power-domains"
property that is a phandle pointing to the corresponding PM domain node.

This way is also applied for hardware blocks that belong to "always-on" domain,
they should be kept as "power-domains = <&pd_always_on>;

Example:

 - 3D-graphic hardware module belong to "a3sg" power domain, add "power-domains" field as:
	gsx: gsx@fd000000 {
		compatible = "renesas,gsx";
		reg = <0 0xfd000000 0 0x3ffff>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 119 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD 112>;
		power-domains = <&pd_a3sg>;
	};

 - GPO7 hardware module belong to "always-on" power domain, add "power-domains" field as:
    gpio7: gpio@e6055800 {
            compatible = "renesas,gpio-r8a7795",
                         "renesas,gpio-rcar";
            reg = <0 0xe6055800 0 0x50>;
            interrupts = <GIC_SPI 11 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
            #gpio-cells = <2>;
            gpio-controller;
            gpio-ranges = <&pfc 0 224 4>;
            #interrupt-cells = <2>;
            interrupt-controller;
            clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD 905>;
            power-domains = <&pd_always_on>;
    };

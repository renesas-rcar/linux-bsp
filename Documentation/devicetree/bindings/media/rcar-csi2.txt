Renesas R-Car MIPI CSI-2 driver (rcar-csi2)
-------------------------------------------

The rcar-csi2 device provides MIPI CSI-2 capabilities for the Renesas R-Car
family of devices. It is to be used in conjunction with the rcar-vin driver which
provides the video input capabilities.

 - compatible: Must be one or more of the following
   - "renesas,csi2-r8a7796" for the R8A7796 device
   - "renesas,csi2-r8a7795" for the R8A7795 device
   - "renesas,rcar-gen3-csi2" for a generic R-Car Gen3 compatible device.

   When compatible with the generic version nodes must list the
   SoC-specific version corresponding to the platform first
   followed by the generic version.

 - reg: the register base and size for the device registers
 - interrupts: the interrupt for the device
 - clocks: Reference to the parent clock

The device node should contain two 'port' child nodes with one child 'endpoint'
node, according to the bindings defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/
media/video-interfaces.txt. Port 0 should connect the device that is the CSI-2
producer. Port 1 should connect the R-Car VIN device (rcar-vin) consumer.

 - ports:
   - port@0: sub-node describing a endpoint to the CSI-2 source
   - port@1: sub-node describing a endpoint to the VIN consumer

Additionally, an alias named csiX will need to be created to specify
which CSI-2 device this is.

Example:

/* SoC properties */

	aliases {
		csi40 = &csi40;
	};

	csi40: csi2@feaa0000 {
		compatible = "renesas,csi2-r8a7795";
		reg = <0 0xfeaa0000 0 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <0 246 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD 716>;
		power-domains = <&cpg>;
		status = "disabled";

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@1 {
				reg = <1>;
				csi40_out: endpoint@1 {
					remote-endpoint = <&vin0csi40>;
				};
			};
		};
	};

/* Board properties */

	&csi40 {
		status = "okay";

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				csi40_in: endpoint@0 {
					clock-lanes = <0>;
					data-lanes = <1 2 3 4>;
					remote-endpoint = <&adv7482_1_out>;
				};
			};
		};
	};

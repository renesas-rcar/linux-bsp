  <title>Metadata Interface</title>

    <para>This is an <link linkend="experimental"> experimental </link>
    interface and may change in the future.</para>
  </note>

  <para>
Metadata refers to any non-image data that supplements video frames with
additional information. This may include statistics computed over the image
or frame capture parameters supplied by the image source. This interface is
intended for transfer of metadata to userspace and control of that operation.
  </para>

  <para>
The metadata interface is implemented on video capture devices. The device can
be dedicated to metadata or can implement both video and metadata capture as
specified in its reported capabilities.

    <title>Querying Capabilities</title>

    <para>
Devices supporting the metadata interface set the
<constant>V4L2_CAP_META_CAPTURE</constant> flag in the
<structfield>capabilities</structfield> field of &v4l2-capability;
returned by the &VIDIOC-QUERYCAP; ioctl. That flag means the device can capture
metadata to memory.
    </para>
    <para>
At least one of the read/write or streaming I/O methods must be supported.

    <title>Data Format Negotiation</title>

    <para>
The metadata device uses the <link linkend="format">format</link> ioctls to
select the capture format. The metadata buffer content format is bound to that
selectable format. In addition to the basic
<link linkend="format">format</link> ioctls, the &VIDIOC-ENUM-FMT; ioctl
must be supported as well.
    </para>

    <para>
To use the <link linkend="format">format</link> ioctls applications set the
<structfield>type</structfield> field of a &v4l2-format; to
<constant>V4L2_BUF_TYPE_META_CAPTURE</constant> and use the &v4l2-meta-format;
<structfield>meta</structfield> member of the <structfield>fmt</structfield>
union as needed per the desired operation.
Currently there are two fields, <structfield>dataformat</structfield> and
<structfield>buffersize</structfield>, of struct &v4l2-meta-format; that are
used. Content of the <structfield>dataformat</structfield> is the V4L2 FourCC
code of the data format. The <structfield>buffersize</structfield> field is the
maximum buffer size in bytes required for data transfer, set by the driver in
order to inform applications.
